// Function to parse quiz data from Markdown (simplified)

  // ... (Logic to extract questions, options, and answers)
}

// Game initialization (example)
// Assuming you have the quiz data in a variable called 'quizMarkdown'
const game = new Game(quizMarkdown, 'classic'); // 'classic' is an example game mode
game.start();

// Event listeners for player actions
// ... (Handle answer submissions, etc.)
// No need for Socket.IO since there's no server communication
